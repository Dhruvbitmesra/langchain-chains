# LangChain Chains 🔗

This repository demonstrates the **Chains concept in LangChain**, which allows you to connect multiple components (prompts, models, output parsers, tools) into a single, reusable workflow.  
Chains are the backbone of building **structured, multi-step GenAI pipelines**.

---

## 🧠 What Are Chains?

In LangChain, a **Chain** is a sequence of operations where the output of one step becomes the input of the next.  
They help move from simple prompt calls to **composable, production-ready AI workflows**.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

- Basic chains using Prompt + Model
- Sequential chains for multi-step reasoning
- Chains with output parsers
- Runnable-based chains (`RunnableSequence`, `RunnableParallel`)
- Clean and minimal demo examples

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Explain

- Why chains are needed beyond single prompts
- How data flows through a chain
- Reusability and modularity in LangChain
- Difference between simple calls and chained workflows

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- LangChain
- LLMs (OpenAI / compatible models)

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This repository is ideal if you want to:
- Understand LangChain’s core abstraction
